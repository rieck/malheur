 Introduction 
 --

 Malheur is a tool for the automatic analysis of malware behavior (program
 behavior recorded from malicious software in a sandbox environment).  It
 has been designed to support the regular analysis of malicious software and
 the development of detection and defense measures.  Malheur allows for
 identifying novel classes of malware with similar behavior and assigning
 unknown malware to discovered classes.  It supports four basic actions for
 analysis which can be applied to reports of recorded behavior:

 1. Extraction of prototypes
     From a given set of reports, malheur identifies a subset of
     prototypes representative for the full data set. The prototypes
     provide a quick overview of recorded behavior and can be used to
     guide manual inspection.

 2. Clustering of behavior
     Malheur automatically identifies groups (clusters) of reports
     containing similar behavior. Clustering allows for discovering novel
     classes of malware and provides the basis for crafting specific
     detection and defense mechanisms, such as anti-virus signatures.

 3. Classification of behavior
     Based on a set of previously clustered reports, malheur is able to
     assign unknown behavior to known groups of malware. Classification
     enables identifying novel and unknown variants of malware and can be
     used to filter program behavior prior to manual inspection.

 4. Incremental analysis
     Malheur can be applied incrementally for analysis of large data
     sets. By processing reports in chunks, the run-time as well as
     memory requirements can be significantly reduced. This renders
     long-term application of malheur feasible, for example for daily
     analysis of incoming malware programs.

 A detailed description of these techniques as well as technical
 background on analysis of malicious software is provided in the
 following articles:

 Dependencies
 --
      >= libconfig-1.4.0
      >= libarchive-2.70

 Compilation & Installation
 --
      $ ./configure [options]
      $ make
      $ make check
      $ make install

      --prefix=PATH           Set directory prefix for installation

      By default Malheur is installed into /usr/local. If you prefer
      a different location, use this option to select an installation
      directory.

      --enable-openmp         Enable support for OpenMP (experimental)
    
      This option enables support for OpenMP in Malheur. Several
      functions of the malware analysis have been enhanced using
      OpenMP directives, such that they execute in parallel and
      benefit from multi-core architectures.

      --enable-matlab         Enable optional Matlab tools
      --with-matlab-dir=PATH  Set directory prefix of matlab installation

      Some functions of Malheur are also available in form of Matlab
      .mex files which allows for using implemented analysis
      methods directly from within a Matlab environment.
